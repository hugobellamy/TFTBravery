# TFT ultimate Bravery Rules  
Basic Rules  
1 - You are only allowed to buy champions that belong to the origin/class you are assigned to!  
2 - You are allowed to take any champion you want in carousel, so you can expand your team buffs!  
3 - You have to always buy your king if it's possible and he must be on the field!  
4 - When you own your king, he has to have the most items  
5 - If caught cheating you must sell all your units except 1  

Notes   
- Thieves gloves counts as 1 item
- A unit may have the same number of items as the king (but not more)
- You can buy extra units to prevent losing minion rounds, but these must be sold before the next player combat
